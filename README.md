# Peogramming Arduino: Getting Started with Sketches - Example Code

The source code for the sketches in the third edition of the book [Programming Arduino: Getting Started with Sketches](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Arduino-Getting-Started-Sketches/dp/1259641635) by Simon Monk published by McGraw-Hill Education (TAB)

This code is also used in [my Udemy course: Programming Arduino](https://www.udemy.com/course/programming-arduino).
